Personal Virtual Assistant with NLP

This Electron app aims to be your personalized virtual assistant, akin to Siri. Powered by natural language processing (NLP) and automata, it's designed to perform simple tasks based on user queries. Users can interact with the assistant via a chat-like interface, inputting commands and receiving responses. The assistant can handle various tasks such as setting reminders, providing weather updates, sending emails, and more. Integration with external services enhances its functionality, while personalization features allow users to customize settings and preferences. Continual updates and improvements ensure a reliable and efficient virtual assistant experience.
